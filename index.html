    <h1>A War on Neighborhoods</h1>
    <p class="h3">
      Millions spent per block on prison sentences in poor areas of color is ineffective and costly to all
    </p>
      
    <p>
      With roughly $8 billion in unpaid bills, the State of Illinois is facing a fiscal crisis.
    </p>

    <p>
      Meanwhile, in 2015 Illinois commited 1.4 billion dollars just to the Department of Corrections, and that number is on the rise <i>despite declining crime levels</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Too many and too lengthy of sentences are handed out for all types of offenses. We give these sentences, overwhelmingly, to Chicagoans who live in our segregated, low-income neighborhoods on the West and South Sides. This amounts to a war on neighborhoods.
    </p>

    <div id="top-mdb-chart">
    </div>

    <p>
      On some blocks, for example, our state committed $10 million dollars of taxpayer money of prison sentences for residents &mdash; over just a 5 year period from 2005-2009. In some community areas, such as Austin on the West Side, this spending commitment is approximately $550 million dollars during the same period. This is wasteful spending at its worst, especially given that research has shown that incarceration does not necessarily reduce crime in neighborhoods.
    </p>

    <p>
      The good news is that are many innovative, common-sense, and creative approaches that are being used elsewhere to expand the menu of options when it comes to public safety.

    <h2>Alternatives to Incarceration</h2>
    <p class="h3">
      The Vision: Reinvesting of Justice  Dollars
    </p>
    <p>
      Justice Reinvestment is an approach to change that identifies key drivers of state incarceration rates and develops practical solutions to reducing or altogether eliminating those drivers. At its core, the approach is committed to shifting government dollars from the unproductive use of mass incarceration to more effective and uplifting investments.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Justice Reinvestment approach has been successfully launched in many states, including : Alabama, Arizona, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Washington, West Virginia, and Vermont. For more background on the successes and challenges of each of these projects, check out the <a href="http://csgjusticecenter.org/" target="_blank">Justice Center at the Council on State Government</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Justice Reinvestment looks differently across each state that has adopted the approach. Meanwhile, there are many interventions that have shown promise in reducing crime, reducing government expenditures and improving human lives, neighborhoods, and cities.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, the following interventions are more cost-effective than incarceration, and have all been shown to be produce successful results:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.delanceystreetfoundation.org/facsf.php" target="_blank">Workforce Development</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.drugpolicy.org/new-mexico/treatment-not-incarceration" target="_blank">Addiction Treatment</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://bexar.tx.networkofcare.org/mh/services/agency.aspx?pid=BexarCountyJailDiversionProgram_364_2_0" target="_blank">Mental Health Diversions</a>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Importantly, while addiction treatment and mental health diversion programs are absolutely essential, they do not actively rebuild healthy economies in high-incarceration areas. As demonstrated by organizations like the <a href="http://www.delanceystreetfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Delancey Street Foundation</a>, rebuilding local economies requires a more fundamental approach to criminal justice reform. 
    </p>

    <p>
      True Justice System reform must go beyond common-sense, low-hanging fruit options such as reductions in sentences for low-level drug offenders. Although this is an important component of reform, there is already emerging bipartisan consensus. And, more importantly, drug reforms alone will not go far enough to reverse the effects that  overincarceration has had on urban neighborhoods. A more successful reform agenda will include deeper reforms for all types of offenses, and stronger reinvestment into solutions that will actually improve communities.

    <h2>Research and Evidence</h2>
    <p class="h3">
      Incarceration has had a devastating impact on low-income African-American neighborhoods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Starting with the identification of ‘million-dollar blocks’ in the early 2000s, researchers have been identifying “hot spots” for mass incarceration. From this analysis, an emerging consensus has developed: incarceration has had a devastating impact on low-income African-American neighborhoods. Meanwhile, more affluent and white areas have gone largely unscathed.
    </p>
    <p class="h3">
      Nowhere is this national trend more clear than in Chicago. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only are the highest incarceration rates concentrated on the city’s West and South sides, but this spatial unevenness has held constant for more than two decades <span class="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="Sampson & Loeffler, 2010">1</span>. As a result, most urban residents with felony convictions come from and return to a small number of neighborhoods. The impact on residents is dramatic. In parts of Chicago’s West Side, nearly 70 percent of men between ages 18 and 54 are likely to have been subject to the criminal justice system <span class="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="McKean & Raphael, 2002">2</span>.
    </p>
    <p class="h3">
      We are unjustly punishing people for their circumstances, not just their actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though mass incarceration definitely targets specific places, it is driven by much more than the behavior of people within any given locale.  Research has made clear that local crime levels are not purely responsible for incarceration rates <span class="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="Sampson & Loeffler, 2010">3</span>. In other words, we are not simply punishing people for the crimes they commit. We are also punishing them for the places where they live, the schools that failed them and the employers that rejected them. And, without question, we are punishing them for the darkness of their skin. These factors work together to shape who gets portrayed as a criminal, and who escapes such portrayals.
    </p>

    <p class="h3">
      Incarceration has been shown to be an ineffective solution to reducing crime, and now more so than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Illinois, more than 50% of prisoners eventually return to prison within three years <span class="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="Council on State Governments Justice Center, 2014">4</span>. What’s more, recent research shows that prison cycling &mdash; the constant cycling of people in and out of prison in neighborhoods like Chicago’s West and South Sides &mdash; may actually lead to more crime <span class="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="Clear, Frost, Carr, Dhont, Braga, Warfield, 2014">5</span>. Another recent study indicates that incarceration, at best, likely had zero effect on crime between the years of 2000-2013. At worst it may have increased crime <span class="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="Roeder, Eisen, and Bowling, 2015">6</span>. Thus, reducing incarceration and reinvesting in improving communities holds the best promise for improving neighborhoods.

      Methodology
    </p>

    <p>
      The map is based on data obtained by the <a href="http://chicagojustice.org/" target="_blank">Chicago Justice Project</a> from the Cook County Circuit Court. It represents all adult convictions between the years of 2005-2009.
    </pa>
    <p>
      Our cost calculation is conservative. We assumed that all those convicted will only serve their minimum sentence; the actual length of time served could be longer. Our calculations also exclude court and policing costs, which are substantial.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our cost assumption is that, on average, the Illinois Department of Corrections spends approximately $22,000 per year for each inmate. Life sentences were calculated based on average life expectancy.
