  <h1><small>Chicago's</small><br />Million Dollar Blocks</h1>
  <p>
    Every year, the State of Illinois spends an incredible amount of money on incarcerating people from Chicago's poorest neighborhoods. 
  </p>
    
  <p>The majority of this money is spent on punishing drug offenders, even though it doesn't change the number of drug buyers or sellers in the city.</p>

  <p>Our public safety system doesn't have to be this way.</p>

  <p>Instead of pouring billions of dollars into incarceration, much of that money could be reinvested in mental health centers, addiction treatment facilities, youth development programs, workforce development initiatives, or other interventions that would reduce crime and improve human lives.</p>

  <p>How would you spend this money to make Chicago neighborhoods safer? Would you invest in transforming lives? Or just shipping people away?</p>
