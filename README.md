# Chicago Million Dollar Blocks

This repo contains code for the Chicago Million Dollar Blocks [website](http://chicagosmilliondollarblocks.com/). This project depends on analysis of incarceration spending in Chicago: code for that analysis resides in the [million-dollar-blocks-analysis](https://github.com/datamade/million-dollar-blocks-analysis) repo.

## Setup
Fork the repository, then clone it to your local machine.

``` bash

We built this site with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Install it:

```bash
gem install jekyll bundler
```

Then, navigate to http://localhost:5000/.

## Credits

The original idea and concept for [Million Dollar Blocks](http://www.spatialinformationdesignlab.org/projects.php%3Fid%3D16) came from Laura Kurgan at the [Spatial Information Design Lab](http://www.spatialinformationdesignlab.org/) in collaboration with the [Justice Mapping Center](http://www.justicemapping.org/) in 2006. This project builds on top of their visionary work.
