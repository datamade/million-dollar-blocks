## Credits

The original idea and concept for [Million Dollar Blocks](http://www.spatialinformationdesignlab.org/projects.php%3Fid%3D16) came from Laura Kurgan at the [Spatial Information Design Lab](http://www.spatialinformationdesignlab.org/) in collaboration with the [Justice Mapping Center](http://www.justicemapping.org/) in 2006. This project builds on top of their visionary work.
